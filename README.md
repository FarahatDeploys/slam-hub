# SLAM and Sensor Fusion Repository

This repository is inspired by the lectures of **Dr. Cyrill Stachniss** and the concepts covered in the **Sensor Fusion course**. It provides a practical overview of fundamental and advanced topics in **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**, including:

## Kalman Filter Figures

The following figures illustrate concepts related to **Kalman Filters** (EKF, UKF, etc.):

- **SLAM Fundamentals**
- **Kalman Filters** and their variants:
  - Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
  - Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
- **Information Filters**
- **Particle Filters**
- **Graph-Based SLAM**
- **Least-Squares Error Minimization**
- **Robust Optimization Techniques**
- **Hierarchical Approaches**
- **Data Association Methods**
- **SLAM Front-Ends**
- **Appearance-Based Techniques**
- **Long-Term SLAM Operation**
- **Semantic Mapping**

This repository combines theory and practical implementation examples inspired by both the Sensor Fusion course and Dr. Stachniss’ lectures to provide a solid foundation for research and application in robotics.
